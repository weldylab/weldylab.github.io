### Collaboration focus

Dr. Thomas Quertermous is a leader in cardiovascular genetics and vascular biology at Stanford University. Our collaboration focuses on dissecting complex genetic mechanisms of vascular disease through the use of advanced mouse models, single-cell technologies, and integrative genomics.

Together, we study how genetic perturbations influence vascular cell states, disease susceptibility, and progression—bridging human genetic discovery with mechanistic in vivo modeling to identify causal pathways in cardiovascular disease.

**Shared areas of interest:**
- Complex mouse models of cardiovascular disease  
- Single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling  
- Genetic mechanisms underlying vascular biology  
- Translational models of coronary artery disease
