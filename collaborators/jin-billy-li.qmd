### Collaboration focus

Dr. Jin Billy Li is a Professor of Genetics at Stanford University and a world-leading expert in RNA editing mediated by ADAR enzymes. Our collaboration centers on defining how A-to-I RNA editing regulates endogenous double-stranded RNA, suppresses inappropriate innate immune activation, and shapes interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signaling.

Together, we integrate RNA biology, human genetics, and cell-type–specific vascular models to understand how variation in RNA editing influences inflammation and contributes to cardiovascular and immune-mediated disease. This work bridges foundational discoveries in RNA editing with disease-relevant biology.

**Shared areas of interest:**
- ADAR-mediated A-to-I RNA editing  
- Endogenous dsRNA sensing and MDA5 activation  
- Interferon signaling and ISG regulation  
- Genetic regulation of RNA editing and disease risk
