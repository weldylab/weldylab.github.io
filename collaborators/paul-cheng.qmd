### Collaboration focus

Dr. Paul Cheng is a physician-scientist at Stanford University whose work spans vascular biology, developmental biology, and human genetics. Our collaboration centers on understanding how genetic variation and developmental origin shape vascular cell states, and how these programs contribute to coronary artery disease.

**Shared areas of interest:**
- Vascular biology and genetic mechanisms of disease  
- Single-cell and multi-omics technologies  
- Developmental biology and lineage-driven specialization  
- Cell state transitions in vascular cells  
- Coronary artery disease biology and risk mechanisms
