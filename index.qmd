## From genetic discovery to cardiovascular innovation

We integrate human genetics with mechanistic biology to uncover causal pathways of cardiovascular disease and pioneer new therapeutic strategies.


### Areas of focus
- Human genetics & causality
- Vascular biology & site-specific mechanisms
- RNA biology (A-to-I editing) and innate immune sensing
- Single-cell and multi-omics approaches
