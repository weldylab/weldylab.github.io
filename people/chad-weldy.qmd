### Bio

Dr. Chad Weldy is a cardiologist and physician-scientist in the Division of
Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University. His research integrates
human genetics, RNA biology, and vascular biology to uncover causal
mechanisms of cardiovascular disease.

His work has led to discoveries identifying **ADAR1-mediated RNA editing**
and innate immune sensing as causal pathways in coronary artery disease,
as well as defining the **epigenomic landscape of human vascular cells**
across developmental origins and disease states.

He received his M.D. from Duke University School of Medicine and completed his internal medicine internship, residency, and cardiology fellowship at Stanford University as a member of the Stanford Translational Investigator Program (TIP). As a research fellow, he conducted research within the lab of Dr. Thomas Quertermous focused on epigenetics, RNA editing, and genetic mechanisms of disease.

Prior to entering medical school, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington and completed a postdoctoral fellowship with the University of Washington, Division of Cardiology where he conducted basic science research investigations within the fields of cardiovascular biology, redox biology, toxicology, and epigenetics. 

Dr. Weldy has a clinical expertise within the field of inherited cardiomyopathies where he treats patients and families within Stanford’s Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease (SCICD) where he trained under Dr. Euan Ashley. 

As a physician-scientist, Dr. Weldy works to better understand human genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptional regulation in cardiovascular disease. Dr. Weldy has received funding through an NIH/NHLBI K08 Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award, an American Heart Association Career Development Award (CDA), an F32 Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship award, and an NIH Loan Repayment Award on his work focused on the genetic, epigenetic, and RNA editing mechanisms of vascular disease. 

Within Stanford, Dr. Weldy has been the recipient of the Gerald Reaven Award for Basic Science from the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, he has been inducted into AOA from the Stanford School of Medicine, and he was the recipient for the Timothy F. Beckett Jr. Award for Best Clinical Teaching from the Department of Medicine.

Dr. Weldy is a native of the Pacific Northwest, originally from Bainbridge Island, Washington. Outside the lab and clinic, he enjoys running, biking, and snowboarding, and spending time with his two energetic children.
