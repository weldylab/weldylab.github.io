### Bio
Dr. Chad Weldy is a cardiologist and a faculty member within the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine and the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease. 
He received his M.D. from Duke University School of Medicine and completed his internal medicine internship, residency, and cardiology fellowship at Stanford University 
as a member of the Stanford Translational Investigator Program (TIP). As a research fellow, he conducted research within the lab of Dr. Thomas Quertermous focused on 
epigenetics, RNA editing, and genetic mechanisms of disease. His work has led to important discoveries in ADAR1 mediated RNA editing and RNA sensing as a causal mechanism 
of coronary artery disease (PMID 40958051, Weldy et al., Nature Cardiovascular Research, 2025) as well as discoveries into the epigenomic landscape of single vascular cells 
across vascular territories giving insight into the genetic etiologies of vascular disease (PMID 40931195, Weldy et al., Molecular Systems Biology, 2025).

Prior to entering medical school, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington and completed a postdoctoral fellowship with the University of Washington, Division 
of Cardiology where he conducted basic science research investigations within the fields of cardiovascular biology, redox biology, toxicology, and epigenetics. Dr. Weldy has 
a clinical expertise within the field of inherited cardiomyopathies where he treats patients and families within Stanford’s Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease (SCICD) 
where he trained under Dr. Euan Ashley. As a physician-scientist, Dr. Weldy works to better understand human genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptional regulation in cardiovascular 
disease. Dr. Weldy has received funding through an NIH/NHLBI K08 Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award, an American Heart Association Career Development Award (CDA), 
an F32 Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship award, and an NIH Loan Repayment Award on his work focused on the genetic, 
epigenetic, and RNA editing mechanisms of vascular disease. Within Stanford, Dr. Weldy has been the recipient of the Gerald Reaven Award for Basic Science from the Division of 
Cardiovascular Medicine, he has been inducted into AOA from the Stanford School of Medicine, and he was the recipient for the Timothy F. Beckett Jr. Award for Best Clinical Teaching 
from the Department of Medicine.

Dr. Weldy is a native of the Pacific Northwest and is from Bainbridge Island, Washington. He continues to run, bike, and snowboard whenever he can while trying to keep up with his 
two active kiddos.
