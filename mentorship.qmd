*My path to science and medicine has been anything but linear.* In fact my path can be easily described as — *backwards*. After undergraduate training, I went directly into a PhD and subsequently a postdoctoral fellowship. It was through this experience that my interest in medicine and a drive to become a physician-scientist were formed.

Ultimately, this led to medical school, residency in internal medicine, cardiology fellowship, another postdoctoral fellowship, and now faculty and principal investigator. Despite this circuitous path spanning nearly two decades, I genuinely feel that, for me, I could not imagine any alternative — **this was the path that I needed**.

Through this journey, I have had the unique opportunity to learn from incredible mentors — as an undergraduate, PhD student, postdoctoral fellow, medical student, resident, fellow, and early faculty member. I often find myself returning to a central question:

*What makes a good mentor?*

---

My impression is that above all:

> *A good mentor identifies the right support, at the right time, for the right person.*

Importantly, the type of mentorship someone needs as an undergraduate, a PhD student, a postdoctoral fellow, or a clinician-scientist is fundamentally different — and *each individual requires distinct mentorship*.

---

As a mentor, I believe in first creating an environment — one grounded in shared respect and intellectual curiosity — and then working to develop a genuine understanding of a mentee’s interests and goals.

*Through that process, we can identify the right support, for the right person, at the right time.*
