## Open positions
We welcome inquiries from:
- Postdocs
- Graduate students
- Research assistants
- Clinician-scientist trainees

## Why join the Weldy Lab?

The Weldy Lab is a growing research group at Stanford University focused on uncovering *causal mechanisms of cardiovascular disease* by integrating *human genetics*, *RNA biology*, and *vascular biology*.

As a new laboratory, we offer a uniquely *close-mentorship environment* where trainees work directly with the PI on high-impact, interdisciplinary projects at the interface of *basic science, genomics, and clinical medicine*.

### What makes training in the Weldy Lab distinctive?

**• Direct, hands-on mentorship**  
Trainees receive close, individualized mentorship with regular access to the PI for experimental design, data interpretation, writing, and career development. Training is tailored to your background, goals, and career stage.

**• Clinically grounded science**  
Our work is motivated by real unmet needs in cardiovascular medicine. Projects are rooted in human genetics and patient-relevant biology, with an emphasis on causal inference and translational impact.

**• Interdisciplinary training at Stanford**  
The lab is embedded within Stanford’s Division of Cardiovascular Medicine and closely connected to the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, the Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, and the broader Stanford genomics ecosystem.

**• Ownership and independence**  
Trainees are encouraged to take intellectual ownership of their projects, lead manuscripts, and develop a clear scientific identity. Early members of the lab help shape new directions and build the lab’s foundation.

**• A supportive, transparent lab culture**  
We aim to foster an environment rooted in mutual respect, curiosity, and enthusiasm for science and medicine. Expectations are clear, communication is open, and mentorship evolves as trainees grow.
