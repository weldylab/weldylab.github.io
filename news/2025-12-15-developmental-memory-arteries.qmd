The Stanford Cardiovascular Institute (CVI) recently featured published a compelling story highlighting our collaborative work from the Weldy, Cheng, and Quertermous labs revealing that **arterial segments carry a molecular “memory” of their developmental origin**, and that this imprint shapes how arteries later respond to stress, injury, and disease. 

The article *“How Developmental ‘Memory’ Shapes the Arteries, and the Diseases They Face”* explains how our two complementary studies (Zhao et al., Cell Genomics, 2025, Weldy et al., Molecular Systems Biology, 2025) — one mapping the transcriptional architecture of human arteries, and another characterizing the underlying chromatin landscape in animal models — uncover how **embryonic lineage influences adult vascular biology and disease vulnerability**.
