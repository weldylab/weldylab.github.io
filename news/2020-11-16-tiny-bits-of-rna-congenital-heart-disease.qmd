Stanford Medicine featured Dr. Weldy's research showing that **tiny pieces of RNA (microRNAs)** in the blood hold clues to heart problems in adults born with tetralogy of Fallot, a common form of congenital heart disease.

The study — published in *PLOS ONE* — measured microRNA expression in the bloodstream of adults who had surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot and also received heart imaging. Researchers found that specific microRNA patterns correlated with **enlargement of the right ventricle**, a key sign of ventricular dysfunction not always fully captured by standard echocardiograms. 

Because microRNAs regulate gene activity and can be measured noninvasively, the findings suggest a promising approach to **improve early detection** of right heart failure — especially in patients whose imaging results fall into ambiguous categories.
