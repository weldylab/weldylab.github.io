A recent *Stanford Medicine* feature highlights research from the Dr. Euan Ashley lab for which Dr. Weldy is co-author, uncovering how **epistasis — interactions between pairs of genes — contributes to inherited forms of heart disease**, moving beyond traditional single-variant genetic models.

Most genetic studies focus on how individual variants influence disease risk. However, many cardiovascular traits, including cardiac hypertrophy, arise from **combinations of genetic variants whose effects depend on one another**. These epistatic interactions can amplify or suppress disease risk in ways that are invisible when genes are studied in isolation.

This collaborative work illustrates how **epistasis adds an important new dimension to cardiovascular genetics**, with potential implications for improved risk prediction, disease classification, and future therapeutic strategies that account for gene networks rather than single targets.
