In a major head-to-head clinical trial funded by Eli Lilly, the newer diabetes drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide) demonstrated a greater heart-protective effect compared with the older GLP-1 therapy Trulicity (dulaglutide) in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.

The study, which included more than 13,000 patients across multiple countries, showed that Mounjaro reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events — such as heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death — by about 8 % more than Trulicity. Patients treated with Mounjaro also experienced a 16 % lower risk of death from any cause compared with those on Trulicity. 

Stanford cardiologist **Dr. Chad Weldy** commented that the new data “may prompt him to recommend switching from Trulicity to Mounjaro, at least for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity or heart issues,” while noting that patient preferences, insurance coverage, and tolerability will continue to influence treatment decisions.

These results, the largest and longest trial yet for Mounjaro, may support expanded cardiovascular indications and inform clinical practice decisions for managing cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes.
