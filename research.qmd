As a physician-scientist I work to understand the genetic basis of cardiovascular disease and the transcriptional and epigenomic mechanisms of atherosclerosis. My work is focused across four main areas of cardiovascular genetics and mechanisms of coronary artery disease and smooth muscle biology:

1.Vascular smooth muscle specific ADAR1 mediated RNA editing of double stranded RNA and activation of the double stranded RNA receptor MDA5 in coronary artery disease and vascular calcification
2.Defining on single cell resolution the cellular and epigenomic features of human vascular disease across vascular beds of differing embryonic origin
3.CRISPRi screening with targeted perturb seq (TAPseq) to identify novel CAD genes in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells
4.Investigation of the epigenetic and molecular basis of coronary artery disease and smooth muscle cell transition in mice with conditional smooth muscle genetic deletion of CAD genes Pdgfd and Sox9

My work is focused on discovery of causal mechanisms of disease through leveraging human genetics with sophisticated molecular biology, single cell sequencing technologies, and mouse models of disease. This work attempts to apply multiple scientific research arms to ultimately lead to novel understandings of vascular disease and discover important new therapeutic approaches for drug discovery.
